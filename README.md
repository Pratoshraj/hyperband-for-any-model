# hyperband-for-any-model

### This project helps to optimize hyper-parameters for any given model using the algorithm hyperband


### For detailed information please go through this research paper - https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06560

### Please refer the python notebook 'hyperband_demo.ipynb' for usage instructions, I've made a demo on how to use this hyperband in an image segmentation task
